            The A380 is a modern icon that has flown over 500,000 revenue
            flights carrying over 190 million passengers. This includes more
            than 300 commercial flights per day, which take off or land around
            the world every two minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flying with the A380 is a unique experience that introduces
            passengers to new standards of in-flight comfort, from first class
            to economy. As the world’s largest and most spacious passenger
            aircraft, its cabin allows travellers to stretch out in the widest
            seats in a calm and relaxing environment. With the unparalleled
            freedom it gives passengers to move about the aircraft, it’s no
            surprise that the A380 is a favourite in all cabin classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The double-deck A380 makes excellent use of its space to offer

            first-class suites, an eye-catching bar or business areas,
            beautifully inviting cabin lighting and the quietest cabin in the
            sky, passengers can enjoy every aspect of the flight and, thanks to
            innovative cabin air supply technology, will arrive at the
            destination feeling inspired and ready to go. The A380 Forward and
            aft lower-deck cargo compartments are equipped with semi-automatic

            The Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest known openings in chess. It
            was mentioned in the Göttingen manuscript of 1490 and was later
            analyzed by Gioachino Greco in the 17th century.In the 18th century,
            it was recommended by Philipp Stamma and is sometimes known as the
            Aleppo Gambit in his honor. During the early period of modern chess,
            queen pawn openings were not in fashion, and the Queen's Gambit did
            not become commonplace until the 1873 tournament in Vienna.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch developed chess theory and
            increased the appreciation of positional play, the Queen's Gambit
            grew more popular, reaching its zenith in the 1920s and 1930s, and
            it was played in all but 2 of 34 games in the 1927 World
            Championship match between José Raúl Capablanca and Alexander
            Alekhine.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the resumption of international chess activity following World
            War II, it was less frequently seen, as many players moved away from
            symmetrical openings, tending to use an Indian Defence to combat
            queen pawn openings; however, it is still frequently played.
